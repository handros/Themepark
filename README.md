# Themepark

This is a JAVA project, where you can create a Theme park with building a custom road, next to it you can place some Attractions, Restaurants and Park elements (such as trees, bushes, and litters). When you are delightful with the result or you ran out of money, you can open the park and the NPC-s are start coming inside at the entrance.<br /><br />

Each NPC has needs:<br />
- Hungry = find a Restaurant, which is not full<br />
- Want to play = find an Attraction -> stand in que and after a while or when its full, it starts working<br />
- Watch the nature = trees and bushes are improving this mood<br />
- Sometimes they throw away some junk -> we can hire a Cleaner or place some litters beforehand<br />
If they can't fulfill their needs, their mood starts decrese (from green to yellow to red). When they have bad (red) mood, they leave the park.<br />
<br />
When an Attractions is overused it can go out of service -> this can be fixed by hire a Repairer.<br />
